## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-16

### Added
- **DAW Configuration System** (`game/core/daw_config.py`)
  - Centralized configuration for audio processing, UI, timeline, undo/redo, and validation
  - Configurable limits for clip duration, track counts, and UI behavior
  - Debug configuration options for different logging levels

- **New Game Locations**
  - **Neon District**: Cyberpunk-themed zone with electronic/synthwave tracks
  - **Frost Peak**: Arctic-themed zone with ambient/ice-themed tracks
  - Both locations have unique track pickups accessible via number keys 1-4
  - Distinct visual styling with custom zone colors

- **Input Validation Module** (`game/core/daw_validation.py`)
  - Comprehensive validation for all DAW operations
  - Validation functions for merge, slice, audio data, track indices, and durations
  - Safe validation wrapper with exception handling
  - Custom `DAWValidationError` exception class

- **Enhanced Error Handling**
  - Input validation in merge and slice operations
  - Better error messages and logging
  - Graceful failure handling with return values

- **Test Suite** (`test_daw_validation.py`)
  - Basic validation function tests
  - Configuration import tests
  - Automated test runner with results reporting

### Changed
- **Merge Functionality**
  - Fixed audio concatenation to properly merge audio data instead of just referencing
  - Added comprehensive validation before merge operations
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Return values to indicate success/failure

- **Slice Functionality**
  - Added input validation for slice operations
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Return values to indicate success/failure

- **Code Organization**
  - Moved hardcoded values to configuration files
  - Centralized validation logic
  - Improved method documentation with proper docstrings

### Fixed
- **Duplicate Class Definition Issue**
  - Removed duplicate `DAWClip` class that was causing merge failures
  - Ensured consistent class definitions throughout the codebase

- **Audio Merge Issue**
  - Fixed merge creating silent second parts by properly concatenating audio data
  - Implemented proper audio array concatenation with numpy

- **Missing DAWClip.delete() Method**
  - Added missing `delete()` method to `DAWClip` class
  - Method properly cleans up audio resources and removes clips from tracks
  - Prevents crashes when deleting clips from the timeline

- **Mute and Solo Functionality**
  - Fixed mute and solo buttons not working properly
  - Implemented proper audio filtering when tracks are muted or soloed
  - Added visual feedback showing mute/solo status
  - Added keyboard shortcuts (F3 for mute, F4 for solo) for selected tracks
  - Muted tracks now properly stop audio playback
  - Solo mode now properly isolates selected tracks
  - **Critical Fix**: Removed duplicate DAWTrack class definition that was overriding the correct implementation

- **Waveform Visualization System**
  - Added real-time waveform display for all audio clips in the timeline
  - Professional waveform rendering with mirror effect and fill areas
  - Color-coded waveforms based on clip state (playing, selected, normal)
  - Subtle grid overlay for better visual reference
  - Performance-optimized with intelligent waveform caching
  - Automatic cache clearing when clips are modified (sliced, merged, etc.)
  - Keyboard shortcut (F6) to manually clear waveform cache
  - Support for both mono and stereo audio files

### Technical Debt
- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - Added type hints to method signatures
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling
  - Created centralized configuration management
  - Added input validation for all critical operations
  - Fixed missing method implementations that were causing runtime crashes

## [Previous Versions]

### [0.1.0] - 2025-08-15
- Initial implementation of Cosmic DAW
- Basic audio slicing and merging functionality
- Undo/redo system for DAW operations
- Full-screen DAW interface
- Audio playback and timeline management

---

## Development Notes

### Code Quality Standards
- All new methods must include proper docstrings
- Input validation should be used for all user-facing operations
- Error handling should be comprehensive and informative
- Configuration values should be centralized in config files

### Testing Guidelines
- Run `test_daw_validation.py` after making changes to validation logic
- Test merge and slice operations with various clip configurations
- Verify error handling works correctly with invalid inputs

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Add unit tests for audio processing functions
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create audio engine abstraction layer
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Implement automated code quality checks
