## 🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode
- **Enabled by default** in `config.py` (`DEBUG_MODE = True`)
- **Shows all function calls** with file and function names
- **Tracks file operations** (load, save, etc.)
- **Helps locate** where file loading errors occur

### Common Issues
1. **File not found errors**: Check paths in `config.py`
2. **Music won't load**: Verify file formats (.wav recommended)
3. **Game crashes**: Check debug output for function call stack

### Debug Output Example
```
[DEBUG] main.py:run() - ENTER run()
[DEBUG] overworld_screen.py:_pickup_track() - ENTER _pickup_track(path=C:\Music\song.wav, zone_name=Mint Lagoon)
[DEBUG] overworld_screen.py:_pickup_track() - FILE LOAD: C:\Music\song.wav - SUCCESS
[DEBUG] overworld_screen.py:_pickup_track() - EXIT _pickup_track() -> Successfully loaded track: song
```

### Disabling Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG_MODE = False` in `config.py` to reduce console output

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python and pygame installed
   - Run: `pip install pygame numpy`

2. **Configure File Paths**
   - Run the setup script: `python setup_paths.py`
   - This will help you configure the correct paths for your music files
   - Update `config.py` with your actual music file locations

3. **Run the Game**
   - Start the game: `python -m game.main`
   - Use the existing audio infrastructure for mixing

4. **Debug Mode**
   - Debug mode is enabled by default in `config.py`
   - Set `DEBUG_MODE = False` to disable verbose logging
   - Debug mode shows all function calls and file operations
